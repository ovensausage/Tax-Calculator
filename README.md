# Python Projects
These are my python projects.

- Tax Calculator (without plotter): it calculates the tax you pay each month and how much of your salary you keep without including national insurance tax. It is based on UK TAX ONLY and isn't 100% accurate. The python file is named Salary.py. I DO NOT GUARANTEE IT'S ACCURACY, IT IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. 

- Name Guesser: It guesses your name if you input the correct information.
