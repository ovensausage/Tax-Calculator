# Python Projects
These are my python projects.

- Tax Calculator (with plotter): it calculates the tax you pay each month and how much of your salary you keep without including national insurance tax, and it represents this information using Matplotlib (you may need to install with pip). It is based on UK TAX ONLY and isn't 100% accurate. The python file is named Salary.py. I DO NOT GUARANTEE IT'S ACCURACY, IT IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. 

- Tax Calculator (without plotter): it calculates the tax you pay each month and how much of your salary you keep without including national insurance tax. It is based on UK TAX ONLY and isn't 100% accurate. The python file is named Salary2.py. I DO NOT GUARANTEE IT'S ACCURACY, IT IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE.
